Welcome to the MadParticle Guidelines!

As the most important part, you should check the `/madParticle Command Guideline` first, then learn using auxiliary design tool in `Designer GUI Guidline` . I'm sorry, it is currently only available in Chinese. You can use browser translation instead.

MadParticle was inspired by [Extinguish](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extinguish-by-uss_shenzhou)'s performance at [Teacon 2022](https://www.teacon.cn/2022/index). It is a mod primarily designed for multiplayer games and datapacks. Instead of adding new particles and textures, MadParticle relies on the reuse of vanilla particle textures, providing almost infinite particles for creating various scenes.

The `/madparticle` command is the most important part of this mod. As the foundational content, you should read the `Command Guideline` thoroughly first. Then, learn to use the auxiliary design tool in the `Designer GUI` and read the remaining chapters.
